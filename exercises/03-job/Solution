 Step 1: Create the Job

Create a YAML file named **random-hash-job.yaml**.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: random-hash
spec:
  parallelism: 2
  completions: 5
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: random-hash
        image: alpine:3.17.3
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - echo $RANDOM | base64 | head -c 20

Step 2: Create the Job

Apply the Job configuration:

bash
kubectl apply -f random-hash-job.yaml

 Step 3: Identify the Pods created by the Job

List the Pods:

kubectl get pods


Pods with names starting with **random-hash-** are created by this Job. These Pods executed the shell command.

Step 4: How many Pods are expected?

* **completions: 5** → Total successful Pods required
* **parallelism: 2** → Maximum 2 Pods run at the same time

**Total Pods expected: 5**

Step 5: Retrieve the generated hash from a Pod

Check the logs of any completed Pod:

kubectl logs <pod-name>


The output is the generated random hash.

## Step 6: Delete the Job

kubectl delete job random-hash



 Step 7: Do the Pods continue to exist?


When the Job is deleted, Kubernetes automatically deletes all Pods created by the Job.

Verify:

kubectl get pods


The Job Pods will no longer be present.
