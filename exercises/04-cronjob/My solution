  1. Create a CronJob named current-date that runs every minute and executes the shell command echo "Current date: $(date)". Use the container image nginx:1.21.6.

YAML wrote to create a cj :

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: current-date
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: current-date
            image: nginx:1.21.6
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date
            - echo " "current-date :" "$date";
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
		  
2. Watch the jobs as they are being scheduled.

Command : kubectl get cronjobs --watch

3. Identify one of the Pods that ran the CronJob and render the logs.

Command : Kubectl logs current-date-29480366

C:\Users\thani\Kubernetes>kubectl logs current-date-29480376-mkw9p
Mon Jan 19 11:36:00 UTC 2026

C:\Users\thani\Kubernetes>

4. Determine the number of successful executions the CronJob will keep in its history.

I can see it shows the recent successful of 3 cj'schedule

C:\Users\thani\Kubernetes>kubectl get jobs
NAME                    STATUS     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
current-date-29480380   Complete   1/1           3s         2m39s
current-date-29480381   Complete   1/1           4s         99s
current-date-29480382   Complete   1/1           3s         39s

5. Delete the CronJob.

C:\Users\thani\Kubernetes>kubectl delete cronjob current-date
cronjob.batch "current-date" deleted from default namespace

C:\Users\thani\Kubernetes>
